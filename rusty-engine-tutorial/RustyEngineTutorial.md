# Rusty Engine Tutorial

---

**Rusty Engine** is an open-source game engine created by wrapping a simplification layer around the [Bevy Engine](https://bevy.org/). It is designed to be beginner-friendly, making it easier for new developers to get started with game development in Rust. _Bevy_ is a powerful game engine (real one) that is more complex and has a steeper learning curve, while _Rusty Engine_ aims to provide a more accessible entry point.

**Rusty Engine** purpose in life is to provide a simple Rust interface so you can play around with Rust without the game engine getting in the way.
