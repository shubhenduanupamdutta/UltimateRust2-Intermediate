// 1. This code looks terrible. Let's start cleaning this up by running `cargo fmt`. If you
// configured your editor or IDE to run `cargo fmt` automatically upon save, you can just save!

// 2. `cargo fmt` is great, but it doesn't add blank lines where there are none. Go ahead and add
// some blank lines in places you think it would make sense.

// 3. Time to clean up! Run `cargo clippy`. Fix up all the warnings so `cargo clippy` is silent.

// Challenge: Clippy doesn't find *everything*. What else would you change to make this code better?
